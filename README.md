# Windows10-Debloat
A simple de-bloat script for Windows 10

This work is based on the excellent work found here: https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/win10script/
The only real difference is that I remove the install of Chocolatey and related applications.


To run this script, use powershell and call the following:
>iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JLpY6'))
